# My solutions to advent of code for 2023

- I'm not racing leaderboard solutions.
- I'll likely do some days in multiple languages, but that depends how I'm feeling each day.
- If the obvious solution reaches outside the standard lib, I'll do my initial solition with the obvious one, but provide a standard lib solution.
- True to "python is great for prototyping", I expect that on days where I solve in python first, the other languages I use will have better solutions.
- Any language specific notes are in a readme.md in that language's folder.
